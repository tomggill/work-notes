 - 6 SMART Goals
 - 1 related to behavioural
- Make data migration retrospective one of my SMART goals.

### Documentation
**Goal**: Enhance the quality of documentation for clarity, accuracy, and usability.
**Specific**
- Write 15 pages of comprehensive documentation covering the key features and functionalities of the developed features (For example, Buy Now Pay Later), data migration programs, and Data Model.

**Measured**
- There are links provided to all 15 pages of documentation created.

**Achievable**
- There will be enough relevant work to write 15 pages of documentation over the course of the following 6 months as I am being put on more feature delivery and there is on going data migration projects which will require documentation write ups.

**Relevant**
- This is directly relevant to current work and is essential to understanding the decisions behind developed features, data migration milestones, and the More Trees data model.

**Time-based**
- 31st December 2024

### Data Migration Retrospective
**Goal**: Conduct a comprehensive retrospective on the recent data migration project to identify successes, challenges, and areas for improvement.
**Specific**
- Conduct a comprehensive data migration retrospective meeting for all More Trees team members to evaluate the data migration project, understand what worked well, identify challenges faced, and derive actionable insights for future projects.

**Measured**
- Produce a detailed retrospective report documenting the findings and a list of 3 actionable items, and have a collection of team feedback on the retrospective process itself.

**Achievable**
- All relevant data and feedback from the migration project are collected and ready for review

**Relevant**
- The retrospective aligns with the commitment to continuous improvement and provides insights that can improve processes, enhance team collaboration, and prevent similar challenges in future projects.

**Time-based**
- 31st December 2024
### Feature Delivery
**Goal**: Enhance my More Trees code base knowledge by delivering features in timely and successful releases.
**Specific**
- Deliver features requested by the stakeholders to improve my feature delivery ability and further prove my ability to successfully deliver features on time.

**Measured**
- Deliver 3 features on time (before my bigger task towards the 4th Quarter).

**Achievable**
- I will be given the opportunity to work on these features in the 3rd Quarter.
- I have the ability to deliver these features and learn the code base. 
- I have access to regular team meetings for ticket refinement and support from managers. 

**Relevant**
- This goal directly aligns with the More Trees objectives set by the stakeholders to improve the quality of the application and drive revenue.

**Time-based**
- 31st December 2024
### Feature Delivery
### Behavioural
**Goal**: Improve my collaboration skills to enhance team productivity and knowledge.
**Specific**
- Focus on enhancing collaboration skills by participating in team-building activities. For example, conduct more pair code reviews to improve knowledge sharing and team collaboration.

**Measured**
- Conduct one pair PR (large) review per sprint.
- Converse with 5 THG employees, outside of the More Trees team, at the office to learn about what they work on day-to-day (this improves cross-team collaboration and opens up opportunities for supporting each other).

**Achievable**
- I will schedule in time with the PR creator to code review with them in a call.
- I am in the office each week so I have the opportunity to converse with co-workers there.

**Relevant**
- This goal aligns with THGs value of teamwork and collaboration as key drivers of success.

**Time-based**
- 31st December 2024
### Personal
**Goal**: Gain knowledge on microservice architecture and system design.
**Specific**
- I will use the resources available on O'Reilly to learn about microservice architecture and system design by reading the books available.

**Measured**
- I will read 'Building Microservices - Designing Fine-Grained Systems' and produce 10 key takeaways which relate to my responsibilities as a software engineer at THG.
- I will read 'Acing the System Design Interview' and produce 10 key takeaways which relate to my responsibilities as a software engineer at THG.


**Achievable**
- I have access to O'Reilly and I have time available to use these resources as I can listen to the audiobooks whilst doing other tasks.

**Relevant**
- Learning about microservices is beneficial because More Trees uses microservices, and I can apply the lessons learned whilst developing new features.
- Learning about System Design is beneficial because as More Trees grows, we will likely need to adopt/change architecture as we develop new features.
