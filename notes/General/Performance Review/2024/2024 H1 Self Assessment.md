### Deliverables - 4.0

Developed a user migration ETL pipeline to extract, sanitise, transform, and insert `3,000,000` records while improving the source data's integrity, monitoring performance metrics (CockroachDB and GCP), and optimising ETL parameters.

Developed a plantation and payment history ETL pipeline to extract, sanitise, transform, and insert `2,800,000` records while improving the source data's integrity, monitoring performance metrics (CockroachDB and GCP), and optimising ETL parameters.

I have pioneered ideas to improve the efficiency of data migration, including pre-processing and caching source data and implementing multi-row inserts. These innovations resulted in a 22x (2200%) speed increase for the plantation and payment history migration compared to the user migration.

Developed an app to generate `600,000` Stripe customer IDs and generate, encrypt, and upload `600,000` API keys to vault, inserting `1,200,000` records into the database.

Innovated and implemented multi-threading for the stripe customer ID and API key generation app to meet the pre-launch data migration deadline, and monitored performance metrics to optimise threading parameters to increase speed by 5x (500%).

Migrated (processed, sanitised, and inserted) a total of `~7,000,000` database records.

I have optimised the efficient use of Jack King's time by preparing database queries, data sets, and tests so that the project can progress efficiently.

I have fought for deliverables by identifying and actioning data integrity roadblocks early, prioritising tasks effectively to maintain momentum and meet deadlines early, and pushing for Jack King's time at critical moments to drive the completion of milestones.

I mentored an engineering Manager on the data schema and data migration requirements, delegating data migration tasks, and monitoring progress to ensure the delivery of the initial user migration app pre-launch, successfully migrating `100,000` users' data, and inserting `700,000` database records.

### Behavioural Assessment - Overall 4.0
#### Ambition - 4.0

During the pre-launch data migration, I worked all evening through to 5AM, waking up at 8AM and working all the following day to ensure the successful migration of `100,000` users' data in preparation for the More Trees launch.
#### Innovation - 4.0

I have pioneered ideas to improve the efficiency of data migration (pre-processing, caching, multi-row inserts, multi-threading), increasing plantation and payment history data migration speed by 22x, and stripe customer ID and API key generation by 5x.
#### Decisiveness - 4.0

I developed solutions to data integrity issues and proposed decisions to Jack King by evaluating their pros and cons. I advocated for and remained firm in deciding the optimal solution while considering stakeholders' concerns.
#### Leadership - 4.0

As the lead engineer on data migration, I consistently generated confluence documentation, created run-books for key migration milestones (user data, plantation data, payment data), and monitored and recorded the performance metrics of migration apps. I analysed performance metrics and optimised migration apps to improve the speed of data migration. I came prepared for meetings with:  
- SQL queries for validating migrated data, identifying data integrity issues, and solving data integrity issues.
- Confluence documentation for runbooks, data integrity issue analysis and solutions, and migration app set-ups.  
- Information on top-priority issues blocking further data migration and solutions to those problems.
#### Collaboration - 4.0

Pushed for consistent collaboration with Jack King to drive progress on data migration milestones. Jack King and myself pair programmed to test and validate migration apps to catch data integrity issues. During peak user and plantation migration, we were collaborating on migrating and validating the data for 6+ hours a day several days a week.

Collaborated with the DBA team to setup a gb1 Cockroach cluster and solve any data import issues for testing the legacy DB data at the start of the project.

Collaborated with Joost to gain knowledge of the new More Trees data schema.
