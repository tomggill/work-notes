Rewrite the self assessment being more concise and relevant - see [[2024 H1 Self Assessment]].
Focus on leadership and innovation.

Improvements: Create concrete examples of ways I will become a mid level engineer in December (Ask Jack for ideas).

Behavioural Assessment shouldn't link to deliverables, they should show how and why I am ambitious, innovative, decisive, etc.

See points on leadership and ambition Jack gave in [[2024 H1 Self Assessment]].

- I need to rewrite the core deliverables and behaviour section to highlight areas which go above and beyond what is expected of a graduate Engineer (Leadership, Innovation)
- I need to be more concise as Jack Owen doesn't have a large section to write information about it.
- I need to define Improvements such that they are quantifiable and can be actioned.
