# 📝 General Notes

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Work with Jack on UAT testing the ticket for remedying the created_when date of pre-launch migrated users and prepare for running on production DB.
- Work on data migration retrospective.
#### What I accomplished
- Ticket for remedying the created_when date of pre-launch migrated users:
	- Fix the out of bound error when updating the created_when dates in the account user table.
	- Use the account user ID to update the account_user table instead of using a composite key of account ID and user ID - using the primary key is significantly more performant.
- Work on data migration retrospective:
	- Complete the success and what went well section- key points (short)
	- Complete the Challenges & Issues section
