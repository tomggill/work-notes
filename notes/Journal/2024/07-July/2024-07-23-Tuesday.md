### 📅 Wake Up
##### 🙌 One thing I'm excited about right now is...
- Releasing the update query for retroactively fixing the incorrect account credits entries, and the bug fix so that `account_credits` is correctly updated when a plantation is made by card.

##### 🚀 One thing I plan to accomplish today is...
-  Release the update query for retroactively fixing the incorrect account credits entries to the DEV and UAT environments.

# 📝 General Notes

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Update my daily notes.
- Finish the self-assessment document.
- Respond to change requests for the bug fix for correctly updating `account_credits` when a plantation is made by card.
#### What I accomplished
- Updated daily notes and finished the self-assessment document.
- Responded to change requests for the bug fix for correctly updating `account_credits` when a plantation is made.
	- This ticket was reviewed by myself and Jack Owen together, we discussed naming conventions, separation of concerns, and possible refactors. 
#### Notes
- N/A
---
## Block Two
#### What I plan to do
- 1-to-1 with Jack Owen about my self assessment.
- Investigate the subscription functionality flow and whether `account_credits` needs to be updated here. 
#### What I accomplished
- 1-to-1 with Jack Owen was constructive.
	- I need to rewrite the core deliverables and behaviour section to highlight areas which go above and beyond what is expected of a graduate Engineer (Leadership, Innovation)
	- I need to be more concise as Jack Owen doesn't have a large section to write information about it.
	- I need to define Improvements such that they are quantifiable and can be actioned.
- I found that the subscription functionality is complex and has many branches. Additionally, there are many branches which don't update the `account_credits` fields.
#### Notes
- #ToDo - Rewrite the self assessment to be more concise.

## Block Three
#### What I plan to do
- Implement and test the `account_credits` update functionality for all subscription flows.
#### What I accomplished
- Implemented the `account_credits` update functionality for subscription flows:
	- Create subscription now.
	- Create subscription now with 3DS.
	- Create subscription later.
	- Recurring subscription.
- Updated the subscription service and payment service unit tests. 
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Four
#### What I plan to do
- Deploy the changes to the plant by card functionality to the DEV environment and test all payment flows.
#### What I accomplished
- I have tested all payment flows in the development environment, and each was successful and updated the `credits_loaded` and `credits_used` fields correctly.
- I created a CAB to deploy the fix for correctly updating the `account_credits` table.
#### Notes
- ...

### 📅 Wind Down
##### 🙌 What did I achieve today
- I have implemented all functionality for the fix to correctly update the `account_credits` table when planting by card.

##### 🚀 How did I struggle today
* I took longer than expected updating and validating failing unit tests after updating the payment service functionality.
	* After the updates to the payment service tests, I was more efficiently able to update and validate the failing unit tests for the subscription service.
