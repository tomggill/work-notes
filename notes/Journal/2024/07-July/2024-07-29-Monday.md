# 📝 General Notes

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Fix the brand cross charge migration app functionality inserting the wrong created_when date into the cache.
- Implement CockroachDB Account Subscription inserts for stripe subscription migration app.
#### What I accomplished
- Fixed the brand cross charge migration app functionality so that the EoM `created_when` timestamp for plantations are correct.
- Implemented Account Subscription Inserts for the stripe subscription migration app.
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Two
#### What I plan to do
- Go through the smoke test plan for the dev app runtime environment.
#### What I accomplished
- I went through the smoke test plan for the dev app runtime environment. Tests:
	- User / Account tests
#### Notes
- I need to go through the remaining smoke test plan for the dev app runtime environment: Tests:
	- Admin tests
	- External tests.

## Block Three
#### What I plan to do
- Test the stripe subscription migration app locally.
#### What I accomplished
- Tested and validated the results for the stripe subscription migration app.
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Four
#### What I plan to do
- Migrate the brand cross charge plantation data.
#### What I accomplished
- Got in a call with Jack King to migrate the brand cross charge plantation data:
	- Created a run-book for the cross charge plantation migration.
	- Tested the migration app in UAT and validated the results by logging in with one of the accounts.
	- Created the brand accounts and invited them from the original migrated accounts in production.
		- For example, `allsole@moretrees.eco` invites `team+allsole@moretrees.eco`.
	- Cached the production cross charge plantation inserts and validated them.
	- Migrated the cross charge plantations in production for the `account_inventories` and `account_ledgers` table.
#### Notes
- I still need to migrate the `account_ledger_recipients` table.
