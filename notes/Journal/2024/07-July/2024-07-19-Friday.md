### 📅 Wake Up
##### 🙌 One thing I'm excited about right now is...
- Getting to work on a ticket which will update the More Trees Backend services.

##### 🚀 One thing I plan to accomplish today is...
-  Develop the update query for retroactively fixing the account credit totals discrepancies caused by the bug where account credits isn't updated when planting a tree directly using a credit card.

# 📝 General Notes

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Develop the update query for retroactively fixing the account credit totals discrepancies.
#### What I accomplished
- Reviewed the PR for removing the `justification` field from the customer payment history activity page. See [here](https://github.com/THG-More-Trees/mt-ui/pull/395#pullrequestreview-2187532154).
- Developed the update query for retroactively fixing the account credit totals discrepancies.
	- This involved ensuring that the query will catch all users who have gone through different payment flows.
	- When a user created an account, they have an account credits record created.
	- In the DEV DB there are payments which don't link to an account or an account credits record, these will be ignored.
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Two
#### What I plan to do
- Test the update query for retroactively fixing the account credit totals discrepancies.
#### What I accomplished
- Review the cab for the update to prevent viewing public API key & remove justification field from users payment details. See [here](https://servicedeskplus.thg.com/app/itdesk/ChangeDetails.cc?CHANGEID=4489000667208158&selectTab=submission&subTab=details).
- Tested the update query by replicating the UAT Data in a local database, then running and validating the results of the query.
- Integrated the update query in a database migration within `mt_transaction` and created a PR. See [here](https://github.com/THG-More-Trees/mt-transaction-management-service/pull/487).
- Created a CAB for the Brand Cross Charge plantation and payment history data migration. See [here](https://servicedeskplus.thg.com/app/itdesk/ChangeDetails.cc?CHANGEID=4489000667225693&selectTab=cab_evaluation&subTab=details).
#### Notes
- Half day today so there is only two blocks.
