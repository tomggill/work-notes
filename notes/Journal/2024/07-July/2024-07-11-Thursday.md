# 📝 General Notes

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Create a run-book for running the core legacy DB payment history migration in the production More Trees DB.
- Begin the legacy DB payment history migration.
#### What I accomplished
- I have created the run-book for running the core legacy DB payment history migration.
- Jack King and myself tested that one of the UAT users we migrated payment history for is able to view their payment history correctly in `Activity History`.
	- Found an issue where yearly subscriptions have gross unit price set to 0.80 instead of a 20% discount.
- Fixed the issue with yearly subscriptions having a gross unit price of 0.80 instead of a 20% discount.

## Block Three
#### What I plan to do
- Continue the legacy DB payment history migration app functionality.
#### What I accomplished
- I updated the app functionality for the legacy DB payment history migration so that migrated payments have their stripe payment intent ID (transaction ID) inserted into the `justification` field.
- I found an issue where the legacy DB yearly subscriptions weren't all being identified correctly.
	- This needs to be investigated.
#### Notes
- The requirements for the legacy DB payment history migration changed around 11am, where the subscription payments need to retroactively be linked to subscription data from stripe.
	- This required a modification to the app functionality to include the stripe payment intent ID (transaction ID) in the `justification` column in the account ledger table
- I need to investigate why all legacy DB yearly subscriptions aren't being identified.

- Create CAB for the release of the legacy DB payment history migration.
#### What I accomplished

### 📅 Wind Down
##### 🙌 What did I achieve today
- I identified and solved several issues with the legacy DB payment history migration app functionality under a time constraint.

##### 🚀 How did I struggle today
- The requirements for the legacy DB payment history migration changed around 11am, where the subscription payments need to retroactively be linked to subscription data from stripe.
	- This required a modification to the app functionality to include the stripe payment intent ID (transaction ID) in the `justification` column in the account ledger table. 
* Jack and myself encountered issues with the legacy DB payment history migration cache data which resulted in the push back of the release date for the migration.
	* The gross unit price was being set to 0.80 for yearly subscriptions instead of it being set to 1 and discount percentage being set to 20%.
	* Not all yearly subscriptions were being identified.
