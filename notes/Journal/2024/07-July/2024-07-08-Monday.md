### üìÖ Wind Down
##### üôå What did I achieve today
- I completed writing the app functionality for processing and inserting the brand cross charge plantation data.
- I completed local testing and UAT testing for the cross charge plantation data migration app functionality.

##### üöÄ How did I struggle today
* Not much of a struggle, but it was time consuming setting up the local test environment for the cross charge plantation data migration app functionality. I felt as if it was a waste of developer time.
