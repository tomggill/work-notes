### 📅 Wake Up
##### 🙌 One thing I'm excited about right now is...
- Completing the cross charge plantation history migration into the production CockroachDB

##### 🚀 One thing I plan to accomplish today is...
-  Write unit tests for calculating and caching the account subscription data.

# 📝 General Notes
---

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Test the calculating and caching of the account subscription data in the stripe subscription data migration app.
#### What I accomplished
- I resolved many compile errors when testing the calculating and caching of the account subscription data.
	- Due to model creation errors.
	- Due to incorrect table attribute references.
- I resolved errors caused by incorrect source data.
	- The source payment history needs to be in a truthful state.
	-  I found an issue with one of the duplicate transaction IDs not being flagged as `migrated = = 0` in the legacy DB.
#### Notes

## Block Two
#### What I plan to do
- Discuss the data migration project progress in standup.
- 1-to-1 with Jack Owen.
#### What I accomplished
- The 1-to-1 session with Jack Owen overrun as we had lots to discuss. See [[2024-07-18]] for the task outcomes and details.
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Three
#### What I plan to do
- Run the cross charge plantation migration.
#### What I accomplished
- There was a new issue found with the new More Trees platform not recording the `credits_loaded` and `credits_used` values when a plantation was made directly using a credit card. 
- Elaborate the tickets required for resolving these issues.
#### Notes
- Unexpected bugs in the new More Trees platform has caused a delay to data migration. This makes my achievements look delayed.
- The fix for these issues requires:
	- Fixing the platform functionality so that it correctly updated the `account_credits` table when a plantation is made directly using a credit card. See [here](https://thehut.atlassian.net/browse/IPMORE-778).
	- Investigate how to identify the true `credits_loaded` and `credits_used` attributes.
	- Retroactively fix the `credits_loaded` and `credits_used` attributes for all accounts. See [here](https://thehut.atlassian.net/browse/IPMORE-779).

### 📅 Wind Down
##### 🙌 What did I achieve today
- I have shown resilience by encountering a serious bug in the More Trees platform which has caused data integrity issues impacting data migration.
	- Despite migrated data being completely correct, due to unforeseen bugs on the platform, the requirements for data migration has been increased. This shows resilience and determination.

##### 🚀 How did I struggle today
- Despite what I achieved today, I have been very stressed during this, and Jack Owens attitude and tone of speaking to me really impacts my mental health at THG.
