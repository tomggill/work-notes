#### What I accomplished
- Tested the app runtime dev environment
	- Suspected cause of the 3DS issue is the stripe web-hook not existing for app runtime endpoint.
	- Tested the external endpoints.
		- Found that `/external/projects/{projectID}/trees/{treeID}` forces authentication with access tokens.
		- Found that `/external/accounts/{accountID}/tree-credit-balance` forces authentication with access tokens.
- Investigated why Vault API was getting a 406
	- Jack Owen found that it was caused by poor data being passed to the get request to vault, and improper error handling for the response returned.
