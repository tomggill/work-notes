# 📝 General Notes
---

## Block One
#### What I plan to do
- Investigate other methods of data migration using ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines.
#### What I accomplished
- I have found several tools which are used for building ETL pipelines.
	- Apache Airflow
		- Free
	- Talend
		- Paid
	- Pentaho Data Integration
- I was able to connect to apache airflow initialised database but found it problematic connecting to a mysql database.
#### Notes
- I would of liked to pursue this but the developer time required to familiarise myself with a new tool would outweigh the benefit of using the tool over my customised ETL pipeline using Java.

## Block Two
#### What I plan to do
- Elaborate the subscription migration ticket.
- Update the cross charge plantation and payment history migration app functionality so that migrated payments dates are set to the start of the month, and the migrated plantations are set to the end of the month.
- Begin developing the app for migrating the stripe subscription data to Cockroach DB.
#### What I accomplished
- Investigated and elaborated the subscription migration ticket.
- Updated the cross charge plantation and payment history migration app functionality.
- Started development on the app for migrating the stripe subscription data.
#### Notes
- N/A

## Block Three
#### What I plan to do
- Continue development on the app for migrating the stripe subscription data to CockroachDB.
#### What I accomplished
- Continued development on the app for migrating the stripe subscription data to CockroachDB
#### Notes
- The subscription app development involved project setup and planning for how payment data will be mapped to subscription data.

## Block Four
#### What I plan to do
- Sprint ceremonies.
- Continue development on the app for migrating the stripe subscription data to CockroachDB.
#### What I accomplished
- I attended and contributed to the sprint ceremonies:
	- Sprint demo.
	- Sprint retrospective.
	- Sprint Planning.
#### Notes
- The subscription app development involved project setup and planning for how payment data will be mapped to subscription data.
